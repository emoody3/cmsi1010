# Lab 15: K'tah

Another lab that utilizes pygame, but we learn to incorporate keyboard movements to make events occur on screen. We are going to create a zombie apocalypse game where you run until you are caught and therefore end the game. Here we are going to learn a lot about basic game functions.

We also capture the idea that classes can both have things in common, and differences. Here we introduce subtype, showing how attributes can be transferred from main classes.
